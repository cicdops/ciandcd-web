			<h3>QuickBuild 3.1 - distributed version control system integration and enhanced .NET support</h3><p>QuickBuild 3.1 is released to integrate with Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Team Foundation Server. This integration makes possible below actions in a continuous integration or release management environment when dealing with these SCMs:</p>
<ul class="square"><li>Retrieve source code for build and test from tip or specified revision.</li>
<li>Create tags for retrieved source code if necessary.</li>
<li>Detect source changes between builds and notify committers under specified condition.</li>
<li>Promote SCM revisions to higher stage, for example from qa to release.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Git, Mercurial and Bazaar integration also includes the gated push feature, with which you can submit ready-for-push commits to QuickBuild for build/test, and have QuickBuild to push them to the official repository automatically after building/testing successfully.</p>

<p>This release also supports to build .NET projects through MSBuild and Visual Studio solution builder.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.pmease.com/features/whats-new/">http://www.pmease.com/features/whats-new/</a> for details.</p>
	
		
			<h3>QuickBuild 3.1 beta1 released to support Git, Mercurial, TFS and Bazaar</h3><br><br>
You may visit <a></a><p>Git, Mercurial, Team Foundation Server and Bazaar support is now in beta. In this beta, QuickBuild can checkout code, create tags, detect changes, view/diff source files from these version control systems. Proof build support is not yet included but will be delivered in future betas.You may visit <a href="http://www.pmease.com/downloads/eap/">this link</a> to download the beta. Any feedbacks or suggestions are very welcomed!</p>
	
		
			<h3>The formal release of QuickBuild 3 is now available</h3><br><br>

This release works tightly with issue tracking systems to provide an integrated view of issues, builds and SCM changes. No longer worry about which issues are fixed in a particular build, or which build a particular issue is fixed in. QuickBuild tracks these information for you automatically! The release management functionality is improved considerably with the ability to use next unreleased version in issue tracker as next build version, and push built versions into issue tracker as released versions. Currently JIRA, Trac and Bugzilla are supported.<br><br>

Other feature highlights in this release:<br><br>

<ul class="square">
<li>Step can be repeated for different set of parameters, either parallelly, or sequentially. For example, you may create a singe test step to have it execute for each combination of possible databases and OS platforms, or have it run on all applicable build agents. This can greatly reduce number of steps needed in a complex build workflow.</li>
<li>QuickBuild can now terminate spawned build processes immediately and reliably when a build is canceled or timed out. You no longer need to manually kill relevant processes to release workspace mutexes. This works on Windows, Linux and Unix platforms.</li>
<li>A non-admin account can now be authorized to administer a configuration subtree.</li>
<li>Multiple promote actions can be defined with the ability to customize the condition of each action. For example, you may define a release action and have it appear only when build is recommended and current user belongs to release manager group.</li>
<li>Inherited settings such as steps, repositories and variables will be displayed directly in descendant configurations. This makes examination and modification of inherited settings much easier.</li>
<li>Build workflow can now be created/rearranged by dragging and dropping steps.</li>
<li>Trends of duration and success rate of each executed steps are now available in statistics tab of a configuration. You can even compare these trends between different steps to find out which step fails the most and which step costs the most time.</li>
<li>SCM changes screen is reworked to support text search in changes between two arbitrary builds.</li>
<li>The same step can now be reused in different composition steps.</li>
<li>Add the option of auto-detecting user time zone from browser to display local date/time.</li>
</ul>

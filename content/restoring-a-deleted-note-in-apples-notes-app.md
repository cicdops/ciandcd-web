I recently deleted a note on my Notes app on my apple laptop. As someone
who is a paranoid keeper of backups, and usually commits all my work to
a repository like git, I don’t worry much about accidental deletion. But
Apple’s notes app doesn’t have any form of version control, and it’s all
too easy to delete something by accident. I have a daily rsync backup
and run time machine, but googling couldn’t uncover a simple way of
getting the note back. So in case someone else needs to do this, [here’s
what I did](http://martinfowler.com/articles/apple-notes-restore.html).

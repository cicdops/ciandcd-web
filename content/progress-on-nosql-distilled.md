Title: Progress on NoSQL Distilled

Time for a progress report on [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NosqlDistilled.html). We’ve
done a

round of technical review and are now pretty happy with the text,

happy enough to move it into production.

</p>

Production for a book these days is both more complicated and more

responsive than it used to be. The next step on the book text is to do

copy-editing and indexing. It sounds like we are going to get the
<a href="http://www.kirsanov.com/">same

people</a> I worked with on [my DSL
book](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html), which will be

excellent news since they did a good job and were happy to work directly

on the XML source in my repository. This simplifies and speeds up the

whole process. They will also do the book design and convert the book

in camera-ready for printing the physical books.

</p>

I suspect, however, that this book will see more electronic copies

than physical ones. In parallel with the copy-editing we’ll be

preparing the electronic copies. We intend to do a rough-cut version

of the book as soon as we can. This should be available through

[InformIT](http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=8877bf0c-92bd-4d0d-8317-d67fe8b88eee),
Amazon, and [Safari](http://my.safaribooksonline.com). I’ll make further
announcements here

as these become visible.

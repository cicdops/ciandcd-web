Title: Activity Update

My site hasn’t seen any updates for over a month, so I thought I’d

make a quick note of what I’ve been up to. On the whole I’m not

someone who tries to make a regular schedule of site updates - I write

as I have the time, energy, and inspiration to do so. Regular articles

were important in the days of magazines, but in the online world with

notifications via RSS and twitter, I don’t see any reason to tie

myself to a schedule.

Usually when I go quiet for a few weeks, it’s due to travel. When I’m

on the grind of speaking I’m too busy, tired, and grumpy to do any

writing. But that’s not the reason for my recent quiet period, as I’ve

been happily at home. Indeed I’ve been working steadily at a couple

more [infodecks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html), and this
involves both working on the content of

the infodecks and on the toolchain to build them. I’ve added more

features to the toolchain in addition to what I had for the

[multi-mobile deck](http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile), which
should provide a more dynamic experience.

I’ve been enjoying the mix of writing and building tools to support

that writing - and I expect to be publishing these infodecks after the

Christmas/New Year slowdown.

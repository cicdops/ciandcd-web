As we’ve announced via Twitter, Kent Beck, David Heinemeier Hansson
(DHH) and I will be doing a [series of video hangouts to discuss
TDD](https://plus.google.com/events/ci2g23mk0lh9too9bgbp3rbut0k), and
the trade-offs around testing and architecture. The first one is on
Friday May 9, at 11:00 Eastern time. The hangout will be around 30
minutes and will be recorded so you can watch it later. We’ll also
release an audio version via a podcast stream for those like me who hate
watching videos.

</p>

The genesis of this is a couple of conversations between us that
happened over the internet after [DHH’s RailsConf
keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M). We found the
conversations really interesting so Kent suggested that we should have
some more of these, and make them available to the wider internet. We’ve
done very little organisation for these - no further than partial
outline - so we’ll be sorting out our direction as we go.

</p>

Since we announced it, there’s been many suggestions to get more people
involved, particularly Bob Martin (Uncle Bob) who has been very active
in the post-RailsConf debate. We’d prefer to stick with just the three
of us, because adding extra people to the mix usually changes the
chemistry of a conversation significantly. We’re sure that if these work
well there will be more hangouts with different mixes of people in the
future.

</p>

We should also say that the conversation may not live up to many
people’s expectations - at least judging by many of the tweets we’ve
seen. Many people speak of looking forward to a “death match” fight
between us. But the whole reason we’re doing this is that our
conversations have taken a very thoughtful nature. We hope to be witty
and entertaining, but we are more interested in exploring these topics
in a way that expands our understanding of each others’ ideas.

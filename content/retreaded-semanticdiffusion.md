I have the habit of creating
[Neologism](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Neologism.html)s to describe

the things I see in software development. It's a common habit amongst

writers in this field, for software development still lacks much useful

jargon. One of the problems with building a jargon is that terms

are vulnerable to losing their meaning, in a process of

semantic diffusion - to use yet another potential addition to our

jargon.

</p>

Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined a

person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets

spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that

definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely -

and with it any usefulness to the term.

</p>

I'm partly prompted to write this because I see this semantic

diffusion happening very publicly to

two terms at the moment: 'agile' and
'[Web2.0](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Web2.0.html)'. Both were coined
in the

last few years and both come with lengthy definitions. (Agile has

the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/),

together with numerous books and
[articles](http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html) by

the authors of the manifesto. Web 2.0 has an excellent
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">definitional

article</a> by Tim O'Reilly.) Yet both of these face a lot of corruption

in the field. I've run into people who think agile methods mean you

shouldn't do any planning and those who think Web 2.0 is solely

about using AJAX. (A more personal case is
[RefactoringMalapropism](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html),

but I'll leave that aside for the moment.)

</p>

Semantic diffusion is essentially a succession of Chinese

whispers where a different group of people to the originators of a

term start talking about it without being careful about following the

original definition. These people are listened to by a further group

which then goes on to add their own distortions. After a few of these

hand-offs it's easy to lose a lot of the key meaning of the term

unless you make the point of going back to the originators. It's

ironic that it's popular terms that tend to suffer from this the most.

That's inevitable, of course, since unpopular terms have less people

to create the Chinese whisper chains.

</p>

Semantic diffusion tends to coincide with hype phase of an idea.

As an idea becomes attractive, lots of people are... well... attracted.
Many

of these followers talk about the term and teach about it. If these

people aren't careful to go back to the source, the Chinese whispers

begin. Popular ideas also spread primarily though communication media

that are more likely to lead to misunderstanding - such as

writing. Many followers aren't fortunate enough to work directly with

the originators and thus learn directly from them.

</p>

A related indicator to popularity is desirability. A word that

sounds good may be more likely to suffer from semantic diffusion.

'Agile' sounds like something you'd certainly want to be, the antonyms

of agile aren't at all appealing. Who would want to still be merely

1.0 of the web? Kent Beck noticed this effect and thus deliberately

picked Extreme Programming as a name because it less inherently

desirable: 'extreme' is often used as a pejorative. Using a less

desirable term may reduce semantic diffusion, but I don't think it

avoids the problem completely. After all we saw semantic diffusion

occur to 'object-oriented' which is a neutral term.

</p>

Semantic diffusion is more likely to occur with things that are

broad concepts rather than hard technologies. Ruby on Rails is

getting a lot of hype at the moment, but since it's a concrete tool

it's hard for its meaning to weaken. Extreme Programming's list of

concrete practices may also reduce this problem compared to agile's

broader list of values and principles.

</p>

Semantic diffusion is a painful process to watch, particularly

for those who find the ideas useful. At the moment I see signs of
despair

for both of these terms, some people in the agile world are talking

of ditching the word agile.

</p>

I'm more sanguine about all this, largely because I've seen it

before. There was a time when almost any software tool or method was

described as object-oriented. But now, years later, the essential

meaning of OO is reasonably well understood. I saw the same thing

happen with patterns. So terms do recover their semantic integrity and

the current diffusion doesn't inevitably mean the terms will lose

their meaning. I'm also less worried about it because I expected it,

again having gone through this process before. I think it's an

inevitable consequence of ideas becoming popular and despite its

problems, I prefer the hype to ignorance. A final comforting thought

is that once the equally inevitable backlash comes we get a refocusing

on the original meaning. As I'm writing this I'm comforted by the fact

that I can't think of a

term that lost its meaning entirely, although I'm sure it's happened.

(SOA doesn't count, as I don't think there ever was a commonly agreed

meaning for that to start with.)

</p>

Whatever the eventual outcome we still have to cope with semantic

diffusion as it happens. One option is abandonment, to drop the

diffuse term and pick a new one. I don't like this option because a

new term only adds to the confusion and even if you're successful you
just

end up repeating the process for the new term. So my preference is to
keep

re-articulating the current terminology, pointing to those who

understand the true meaning.

</p>

A further complication is that these terms also shift. I'm sure

if you asked the original seventeen authors of the agile manifesto,

they would come up with a different document today. (Let alone the

fact that that group wouldn't be the best group to speak for the

movement today.) Again it's a responsibility for those who are

identified as originators to point this out, both by talking about the

way the ideas evolve and by pointing to new people who are playing an

active role in that evolution. (I'm pleased that the original

seventeen
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html">"let the ship

sail"</a> to go its own way.) Let's not forget there's a tricky

balance between holding to a clear definition and dogmatism.

</p>

All of this is hard work, but a good term is worth fighting for -

particularly since the only bullets you need are words.

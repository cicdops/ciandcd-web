When someone is looking at what makes up a top-class enterprise

software developer, often the conversation may turn to knowledge of

frameworks and languages, or perhaps the ability to understand

complicated algorithms and data structures. For me, one of the most

important traits in a programmer, or indeed in a development team,

is something that I'll call Customer Affinity. This is the interest

and closeness that the developers have in the business problem that

the software is addressing, and in the people who live in that

business world.

</p>

There are many aspects to customer affinity. The first one is

just the interest in the business, its processes and rules. I've

always been fascinated by domains I've worked in: health care,

derivatives, payroll, leasing - are all examples of really

interesting domain problems with a lot of complexity that has to be

organized and understood. For me aspects of a project such as

object-relational mapping, remote process communication - what I

think of as the plumbing of enterprise systems, don't have that same

interest.

</p>

It's important that a team has the plumbing working and under

control, but I believe that the more energy goes into the business

problem, the more effective at providing value a team will be. Which

is a good reason to use frameworks that solve and simplify as much of

the plumbing as possible.

</p>

Another aspect of customer affinity is the ability to

collaborate with domain experts. I don't think that detailed

knowledge of the domain is an important thing for programmers to

have; useful yes, but not important. What's more critical than

knowledge is the ability to collaborate with those that have the

knowledge.

</p>

My high regard for customer affinity is one the main reasons why

I'm such a fan of Extreme Programming and other agile methods. I

found it very significant that when Kent Beck summarized XP to his

agile peers at the snowbird workshop which coined 'agile', he chose

to describe not the technical elements of XP, but his desire to

change the nature of the customer/developer interaction.

</p>

I've often heard this relationship mis-characterized. In

particular there is a belief in some quarters that the customer team

just comes up with stories which they throw at the developers. This

characterization is rather like the notion that requirements are just

lying out there to be gathered. Either way that's

not much of a collaboration. Instead developers need to work together

with domain people to

generate ideas with developers learning a lot about the business in

the process.

</p>

One of Kent's suggested names for 'Agile' was

*conversational* software development - the point being that it's

a two way communication. This isn't something like a telecoms protocol

that you can define, but the back and forth discussions about how

software can enhance the business are where the real value

lives. Much of this conversation is of half-baked ideas, some of which

grow into valuable features - often ones that aren't things that the

customer originally thought of.

</p>

One of the things that frustrates me is how organizations often

try to squelch customer affinity. It's not something people admit to

doing, but it's a common consequence of other

decisions. Organizational barriers can contribute to squelching -

I've come across places where

you have to get your manager to arrange with another manager just so

you can have a conversation with someone on the business side. That

hardly encourages you to get inside the workings of the business.

</p>

I've often heard it said that enterprise software is boring, just

shuffling data around, that people of talent will do "real" software

that requires fancy algorithms, hardware hacks, or plenty of

math. I feel that this usually happens

due to a lack of customer affinity. The real intellectual challenge

of business software is figuring out what the real

contribution of software can be to a business. You need both good

technical and business knowledge to find that. Working closely with

business people to develop this knowledge, and

[PleasingTheCustomer](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PleasingTheCustomer.html)
as you do it, is what makes

enterprise software development fun - and motivation is the key to good

and productive work.

</p>

There are plenty of bright and capable people who want to learn

about the businesses they write software for. Too often

organizations make it hard for them to do so. Until that changes,

our profession will continue to under-deliver on our potential.

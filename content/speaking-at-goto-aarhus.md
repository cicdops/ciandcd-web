As in so many previous years, I’ll be speaking at the the
<a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/">goto

conference</a> (formerly known as JAOO) in early October. This is an

excellent conference with a good range of material across both

technology and process. This year I’ll be participating in a pair of

tutorials.

</p>

On Oct 9 I’ll be with Jez Humble doing our full-day tutorial on

Continuous Delivery, the first time we’ve brought this tutorial to

Aarhus. This will cover much of the ground in Jez and Dave’s award

winning book including the business case for Continuous Delivery,

deployment pipelines, testing strategies, version control

organization, and recipes for going live. We’ve had a lot of good

feedback on this tutorial so far, so I’m glad to finally bring this to

my favorite conference.

</p>

On Oct 13 I’ll join Rebecca Parsons to talk about Evolutionary

Architecture. Rebecca’s long been our chief technical firefighter on

difficult projects, which often have complicated dependencies to

enterprise architecture. I’ve long been urging her to talk more about

her experiences and techniques for handling these issues, so it will

be good to work with her on this tutorial.

</p>

In between I’ll be hanging around the conference catching up on all

the good pickings that will be available.

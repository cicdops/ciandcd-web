You may have noticed some photos cropping up in my news feed. Like

many geeks I indulge in photography. So far this has been a harmless

personal diversion, but I’ve reached the point where I’m feeling a

desire to share some of my photos with the Internet - just in case we

have a shortage. So you’ll see photos appear in my photostream from

time to time. I intend to post no more than one or two a week.

We have now released the latest version of the ThoughtWorks Technology

Radar. This is where a bunch of my colleagues get together and discuss

the technologies that they think are worth keeping an eye on. It’s not

intended to be some comprehensively researched list, as it’s just the

aggregation of the opinions of the small group of people that create

it. But since that group is an experienced group of ThoughtWorks

consultants, I think it’s a useful pointer to things to pay attention

to in enterprise software.

I’ve added another [recommended podcast to my
list](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Podcasts.html), this

one a is a treasure if you enjoy good fiction.
<a href="http://www.reallylikethisbook.com/">Why I Really Like This

Book</a> is a quirky sail through the lesser known waters of English

Literature. The pilot is Kate Macdonald, who teaches English

Literature but was frustrated at the limited range of books she could

cover. Each podcast spends ten minutes or so exploring a single

suggested book. Her first series was a random alphabetical wander, now

she’s taken to talking about sets of five books with a common theme.
Recent

sets include Five Appalling Fictional Women and Five Classic Detective

Novels. If you’re looking for ideas for books to curl up with, this is

an excellent source of suggestions.

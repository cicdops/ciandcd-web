This weekend, ThoughtWorks is hold a recruiting event in New York

City. The idea is to compress the whole recruiting cycle down to a

single weekend. The coding problem will be on Saturday, and those that

pass that hurdle will be invited back for interviews on Sunday. The

idea is that we’ll get job offers to any successful candidates by

Sunday evening. I’ll be there for the first couple of hours on

Saturday.

This last weekend was the ThoughtWorks North American awayday. Following
the suicide earlier this year of Aaron Swartz, we had a theme around the
role of the internet and the software profession to combat overreaching
government and corporate power; featuring speeches by [Birgitta
Jonsdottir](http://joyb.blogspot.com), [Michael
Ratner](https://twitter.com/justleft), and (by video link) Julian
Assange. It was merely a happy coincidence that this weekend
corresponded with successive leaks of troubling activities by government
agencies under the Obama administration.

As I boarded the flight home, I read the news of Edward Snowden’s
[account of why he made these
leaks](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance),
and furthermore, why he chose to publicly take responsibility for them.
Based on the information I currently have, I am struck with admiration
for the courage and thoughtfulness of Edward Snowden’s actions. The path
of a whistleblower is not an easy route, because it rests on the
difficult dilemma between breaking the trust of the community we work
with and our responsibility to our wider community: our country and
humanity as a whole. I have had mixed feelings about some of the
whistleblowing against the US government in recent years, some cases
I’ve admired, but in other cases I’ve felt that the secrets revealed
have not measured up to the high standards required by breaking that
smaller trust.

</p>

In Edward Snowden’s case, these secrets so far have met that high
standard. I am concerned both by these actions of the US government and
by the secrecy that’s obscured these actions - a secrecy that makes it
impossible for we the people to debate the correctness of our
representatives’ policies. I hope we the people will support a public
servant who put his responsibility to us over the government that serves
us.

Title: Beaten Again

In the software world, we have the [Jolt
awards](http://drdobbs.com/joltawards). These were

originally run by Software Development magazine and are now run by Dr

Dobbs magazine. My books have won a couple of ‘productivity awards’ -

which are essentially the runner-up awards - but I’ve never snagged to

top award (now called the ‘excellence award’). This year my [DSL book][]

was up for an award and [won a ‘finalist award’][dsl jolt] (essentially
this means

I was runner-up to the runner-ups).

</p>

So I failed again, but this year I would have been very annoyed if

I had won. I’ve argued all year that Jez and Dave’s book on [Continuous

Delivery][cd book] was the most important book released this year, and
so I’m

glad that Dr Dobbs [agreed with me][cd jolt] and gave them the
excellence award.

Congratulations to Jez and Dave in joining the long list of people who

have kept me away from this award.

</p>

Although I keep missing the top prize, my signature series has a very

good record with these awards. The 10 books in my series so far have

picked up 1 finalist, 4 productivity and 2

excellence awards. Not a bad hit rate.

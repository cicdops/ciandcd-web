Title: Malware alert on thoughtworks.com

Slug: malware-alert-on-thoughtworkscom

We seem to have a shy but annoying piece of malware hanging out on
thoughtworks.com. As far as we can tell, it manifests itself as a hidden
iframe that redirects you to a site that hosts malware. We’re a bit
vague on this, as it only appears rarely so only a couple of people have
seen it.

</p>

Our biggest sign of it is via google. Google reported our site on Jan
7th as having problems, we looked into it, didn’t find anything, and
Google’s complaint went away very quickly. The flag went up again on Jan
31st and this time they emailed our webmaster. We looked again for a
problem, without any success, so we asked them to re-review our site.
Since then various Google diagnostics have raising and lowering the
suspicious flag at a dizzying rate. As I write this the site is
considered safe, but given the volatility of the opinion, we aren’t sure
about how things will go. (If you’re concerned you can check [Google’s
safebrowsing
link](http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=www.thoughtworks.com).)

</p>

Clearly this is a bit of malware that’s set to only show itself
occasionally, which makes it harder to deal with. The tricky bit is to
find how it’s getting into the site. We’ve checked all our content and
not found anything suspicious, but it could be third party javascript
libraries, could be our Drupal instance, could even be a problem with
our apache installation - but we don’t know for sure.

</p>

We’re investigating this further (including following the
recommendations of
[stopbadware](http://www.stopbadware.org/home/security)) but haven’t yet
found the root cause, although we do have some strong suspects. If you
see anything suspicious on our site or would like to pass on any
suggestions, please contact [Andy
Yates](http://martinfowler.com/mailto:webmaster@thoughtworks.com).

</p>

As far as I know, this problem [does not
affect](http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=martinfowler.com)
martinfowler.com - which is a static site built with my custom scripts,
so is less likely to attract such a problem. But do let me know if you
see anything.

It’s only just over a year since I got my first ebook reader. Now I

only buy paper books when I really have to. I wrote my last book

thinking of it primarily as a paper book, but that will be the last

time, in the future electronic forms will be at the front of my

mind. It’s clear ebooks will change the book industry in a dramatic

way, but it’s not clear exactly how. Here are my current thoughts on

what’s happening.

SE Radio has long been my favorite podcast on software development,

so I’m always happy to appear on it. I’m extra-pleased this time,

because it gives me the chance to highlight some valuable software
development

techniques that I feel are particularly under-used.

When we first started using agile methods at the beginning of this

century, one of our biggest questions was how to handle database

design in an agile way. Fortunately we had Pramod Sadalage around, a

DBA who was determined to find a way to incorporate databases with the

agile working style. He developed a set of techniques, including

regular database refactoring and scripted migrations that are

version-controlled with application code. These techniques have now

becomes habitual for ThoughtWorks but have not been as widely adopted in

the industry as I believe they should. This podcast provides an hour

or so that outlines how this all works, which I’m hoping will encourage

greater usage of them.

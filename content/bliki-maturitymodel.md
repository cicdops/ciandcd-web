A maturity model is a tool that helps people assess the current

effectiveness of a person or group and supports figuring out what

capabilities they need to acquire next in order to improve their

performance. In many circles maturity models have gained a bad

reputation, but although they can easily be misused, in proper hands

they can be helpful.

</p>

Maturity models are structured as a series of levels of

effectiveness. It's assumed that anyone in the field will pass

through the levels in sequence as they become more capable.

</p>

So a whimsical example might be that of mixology (a fancy term

for someone who makes cocktails). We might define levels like

this:

</p>

1.  Knows how to make a dozen basic drinks (eg "make me a Manhattan")
2.  Knows at least 100 recipes, can substitute ingredients (eg
    </p>
    <p>
    "make me a Vieux Carre in a bar that lacks Peychaud's")
3.  Able to come up with cocktails (either invented or recalled)

    </p>
    with a few simple constraints on ingredients and styles (eg

    <p>
    "make me something with sherry and tequila that's moderately
    sweet").

Working with a maturity model begins with assessment, determining

which level the subject is currently performing in. Once you've

carried out an assessment to determine your level, then you use the

level above your own to prioritize what capabilities you need to

learn next. This prioritization of learning is really the big

benefit of using a maturity model. It's founded on the notion that

if you are at level 2 in something, it's much more important to

learn the things at level 3 than level 4. The model thus acts as

guide to what to learn, putting some structure on what otherwise

would be a more complex process.

</p>

The vital point here is that <b>the true outcome of a maturity model

assessment isn't what level you are but the list of things you need

to work on to improve</b>. Your current level is merely a piece of

intermediate work in order to determine that list of skills to

acquire next.

</p>

Any maturity model, like any model, is a simplification: wrong

but hopefully useful. Sometimes even a crude model can help you

figure out what the next step is to take, but if your needed mix of

capabilities varies too much in different contexts, then this form

of simplification isn't likely to be worthwhile.

</p>

A maturity model may have only a single dimension, or may have

multiple dimensions. In this way you might be level 2 in 19th

century cocktails but level 3 in tiki drinks. Adding dimensions

makes the model more nuanced, but also makes it more complex - and

much of the value of a model comes from simplification, even if it's

a bit of an over-simplification.

</p>

As well as using a maturity model for prioritizing learning, it

can also be helpful in the investment decisions involved. A maturity

model can contain generalized estimates of progress, such as "to get

from level 4 to 5 usually takes around 6 months and a 25%

productivity reduction". Such estimates are, of course, as crude as

the model, and like any estimation you should only use it when you have
a

clear
[PurposeOfEstimation](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PurposeOfEstimation.html).
Timing estimates can also be

helpful in dealing with impatience, particularly with level changes

that take many months. The model can help structure such

generalizations by being applied to past work ("we've done 7 level

2-3 shifts and they took 3-7 months").

</p>

Most people I know in the software world treat maturity models

with an inherent feeling of disdain, most of which you can understand

by looking at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model">Capability

Maturity Model</a> (CMM) - the best known maturity

model in the software world. The disdain for the CMM sprung from two

main roots. The first problem was the CMM was very much associated

with a document-heavy, plan-driven culture which was very much in

opposition to the agile software community.

</p>

But the more serious problem with the CMM was the corruption of

its core value by certification. Software development companies

realized that they could gain a competitive advantage by having

themselves certified at a higher level than their competitors - this

led to a whole world of often-bogus certification levels,

levels that lacked a
[CertificationCompetenceCorrelation](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CertificationCompetenceCorrelation.html).
Using a

maturity model to say one group is better than another is a classic

example of ruining an informational metric by incentivizing it. My

feeling that anyone doing an assessment should never publicize the

current level outside of the group they are working with.

</p>

It may be that this tendency to compare levels to judge worth is a

fundamentally destructive feature of a maturity model, one that will

always undermine any positive value that comes from it. Certainly it

feels too easy to see maturity models as catnip for consultants

looking to sell performance improvement efforts - which is why

there's always lots of pushback on our internal mailing list whenever

someone suggests a maturity model to add some structure to our

consulting work.

</p>

In an email discussion over a draft of this article, [Jason
Yip](http://jchyip.blogspot.com/)

observed a more fundamental problem with maturity models:

> In other words,

</p>

Jason's observation doesn't mean maturity models are never a good

idea, but they do raise extra questions when assessing their

fitness. Whenever you use any kind of model to understand a

situation and draw inferences, you need to first ensure that the

model is a good fit to the circumstances. If the model doesn't fit,

that doesn't mean it's a bad model, but it does mean it's

inappropriate for this situation. Too often, people don't put enough

care in evaluating the fitness of a model for a situation before

they leap to using it.

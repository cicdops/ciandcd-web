I’m a fan of Eurogames - a style of approachable, yet thoughtful board
games. I like them because you can usually learn and play one in an
evening, yet they provide enough strategic interest to play many times.
I sometimes get asked more about them and what and what my favorites
are. So here is a short article explaining them and an interactive list
of the games on my shelf.
